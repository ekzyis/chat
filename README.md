## Examples

This repository includes two examples to demonstrate basics about socket programming.
One is from [linuxhowtos.org](http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm) and the other is from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/). I added comments in those files for better understanding but except that they are unmodified.
